# Documentation

View the documentation online at: TODO

The following changes need to be addressed in the documenation:
- Main page mentions [Google groups](/trac/wiki/GettingHelp#WarewulfGoogleGroups) or [IRC](/trac/wiki/GettingHelp#IRCInternetRelayChat), which appear to be out of date.
- Warewulf common has a section on Data Store and there is a seperate file for it, they are not linked.
- Many places use **bold** instead of `code`
- Move all provisioning from _General_ to the provisioning folder.
